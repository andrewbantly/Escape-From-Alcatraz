# Escape From Alcatraz

Itâ€™s 1963 and you just busted out of Alcatraz Prison! Only a two mile swim across the San Francisco Bay separates you from freedom, but the Coast Guard will arrive in 30 minutes! Be careful though, you could be spotted or run out of energy. Swim across the bay in time to win the game!

## About the Game 
To escape from Alcatraz, the player will have a top-down view of their swim across the San Francisco Bay. After the player clicks ``` start game ```, the player will be in the water and have the opportunity to swim faster, slower, right, and left. The player needs to avoid obstacles, such as being spotted by police or intense currents. Swimming in currents will lower the players energy significantly. Lastly, the player needs to get to land in less than 30 min (real time 90 seconds) or else the Coast Guard will appear and the player will lose the game and return to Alcatraz.
