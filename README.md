# Escape From Alcatraz

## Pitch  

> It’s 1963 and you just busted out of Alcatraz Prison! Only a two mile swim across the San Francisco Bay separates you from freedom, but the Coast Guard will arrive in 3 min! Be careful though, you could be spotted or run out of oxygen. Swim across the bay to land to win the game!
