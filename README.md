# Escape From Alcatraz

You just busted out of Alcatraz Prison and only a swim across the San Francisco Bay separates you from freedom! Be careful though, you could be spotted by the cops.

After the player clicks ``` start game ```, the player will be in the water and have the opportunity to swim forwards, backwards, right, and left. The player needs to avoid the police in order to win the game.
